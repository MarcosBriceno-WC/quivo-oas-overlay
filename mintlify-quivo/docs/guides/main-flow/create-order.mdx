title: Create a Fulfillment Order
description: Programmatically submit a new fulfillment order to the Quivo Connector using the REST API

By the end of this guide, you have successfully triggered a "Pick & Pack" process in the warehouse for your product.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Authentication Token:** A valid Bearer token. See the [Authentication guide](/essentials/authentication) to learn how to obtain one.
- **Seller ID:** The unique integer ID for your merchant account. Use `GET /sellers` to find it.
- **Product SKU:** You must have created at least one product in the system via the endpoint `POST /articles` before you can order it.
- **Base URL:** Replace `${BASE_URL}` with your environment URL.

## Prepare the order payload

To create an order, construct a JSON object that matches the `OrderPost` schema.

You must provide four main components in the payload:

1. **Seller Context:** Identifies the merchant account.
2. **Identifiers:** Unique IDs to track the order and prevent duplicates.
3. **Recipient:** The destination for the package (`deliveryAddress`).
4. **Content:** The list of items to ship (`positions`).

The following example shows a complete order request payload. Replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

```json
{
  "sellerId": <YOUR_SELLER_ID>,
  "orderIdentifier": "<YOUR_ORDER_IDENTIFIER>",
  "orderReference": "<YOUR_ORDER_REFERENCE>",
  "deliveryAddress": {
    "company": "<YOUR_COMPANY_NAME>",
    "name": "<RECIPIENT_NAME>",
    "email": "<RECIPIENT_EMAIL>",
    "street": "<YOUR_STREET_ADDRESS>",
    "city": "<YOUR_CITY>",
    "zip": "<YOUR_ZIP_CODE>",
    "countryIso2": "<YOUR_COUNTRY_CODE>"
  },
  "positions": [
    {
      "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
      "quantity": <QUANTITY>
    },
    {
      "sku": "<YOUR_SKU>",
      "name": "<PRODUCT_NAME>",
      "quantity": <QUANTITY>
    }
  ]
}
```


## Send the request

Submit the payload to the `/orders` endpoint using `POST` following the example below. You must include both the `X-Api-Key` and the `Authorization` token in your headers.

```bash
curl -X POST "${BASE_URL}/orders" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <YOUR_STATIC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '@payload.json'
```

When the request succeeds, the API returns a 200 OK status code and an `OrderPostResult` object.

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Order created successfully",
  "orderId": <YOUR_ORDER_ID>
}
```
Capture the `orderId` from the response. You need this ID to track the order status later.

## Next steps

Now that you have created the order, the warehouse team receives the Pick & Pack instruction automatically. Continue with these guides:
